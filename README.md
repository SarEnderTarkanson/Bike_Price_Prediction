# Bike_Price_Prediction
This is an ML Model that is designed to make the prediction for motobikes, some specifications of which are given.

Firstly we do exploratory data analysis (EDA). In the EDA we do many things such as uploading the dataset, checking the missing values, dealing with outliers and pairplotting.

Later we create the dummy variables with the help of the pandas function get_dummies.

After transforming the necessary data into dummy variables, we start splitting the dataset into train and test.

Then we do scaling, using the StandardScaler function from sklearn. We certainly scale both the train and test sets.
